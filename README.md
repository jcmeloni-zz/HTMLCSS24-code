About the Book
==============
This book is an update of the 7th edition written by Michael Morrison (he wrote editions one through seven) in 2005 -- when I wrote this edition in 2010 the content was already woefully out of date. This 8th edition is almost a complete re-write and re-organization of the content, although some examples have been kept as an homage to the previous author. 

The goal of this book is to give you a taste of all the skills you need to create a modern, standards-compliant web site in just 24 short, easy lessons&mdash;no, I don't think you can teach yourself the basics in a day...it's a marketing thing. This book covers XHTML and CSS, and HTML 5 where applicable (although it is not a how-to for HTML 5). The book also includes some basic advice for setting up a web site, such as designing an effective page layout, uploading with FTP software, organizing and managing multiple pages, and SEO.  These topics are all covered in enough detail to get you beyond the snags that often frustrate beginners.

This book is not intended as the be-all and end-all of your education in this matter: itâ€™s a **first step**, which will hopefully illuminate the pathways of all the other steps you will need to take to become an expert in these areas.  

The book's ISBN is 0672330970, and was published by Sams in 2010.

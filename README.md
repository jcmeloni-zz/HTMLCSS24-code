About the Book
==============

This edition is a long-awaited update to the 8th edition published in 2010.  Three years is a long time--long enough for the HTML5 recommendation to settle down a little bit and for browsers to increase support for some of the useful (& cool) things that HTML5 has to offer. 

The goal of this book is to give you a taste of many of the skills you will need to create a modern, standards-compliant web site using HTML5 and CSS3. The purely technical stuff is not enough, so this book also includes advice for setting up your own domain, uploading with FTP software, and even a little bit about using GitHub (among other things), all in enough depth to get you beyond the snags that often frustrate beginners

This book is not intended as the be-all and end-all of your education in this matter: it's a **first step**, which will hopefully illuminate the pathways of all the other steps you will need to take to become an expert in these areas.  

The book's ISBN is 0672336146, and will be published by Sams in December 2013.
